Designing a reliable assistive robot means more than bolting sensors onto a gripper. In this project I
built a perception stack that transforms raw tactile signals into contextual awareness the robot can
use during unstructured household tasks.

## From forces to features

I capture high-frequency shear and normal forces from a custom tactile array. A lightweight Rust
process compresses and streams those values into my Next.js control surface where an on-device model
performs feature extraction:

```ts
export function normalizeForceSample(sample: ForceSample) {
  const shear = sample.shear.readings.map(value => value / 32);
  const pressure = sample.pressure / 128;

  return {
    shear,
    pressure,
    timestamp: sample.timestamp,
  };
}
```

Normalizing the values like this gives the downstream planner a stable signal regardless of which
attachment a participant prefers.

## Guard rails for safety

Every frame is labeled with a risk score and compared to the participant's personalized thresholds.
If the score drifts, the system scales velocity, announces the issue through the UI, and requests a
confirmation before the robot continues.

> Research should feel human. The most rewarding feedback from our participants was that the robot
> "understood when to pause"—exactly the behavior this tactile reasoning stack unlocks.

## What I am shipping next

The next iteration will merge proprioceptive data with tactile contact patches to improve pose
estimation when occlusions make vision unreliable. That fusion layer is underway now, and I will
share the results here soon.
